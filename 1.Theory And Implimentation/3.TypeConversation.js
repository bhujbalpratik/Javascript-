/*
    Important Notes on Type Conversation

    1) Javascript considers 0 as false and all non-zero numbers as true, and if true is converted to a number, the result is always 1.

    2)string() takes null and undefined and converts them to string.

    3)In javascript,"Undefined,Null,0,Not A Number(NaN)", converts to false. All other values give true.
